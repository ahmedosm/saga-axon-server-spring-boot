## Automated CI/CD Pipeline Process

### Process Overview

The diagram below illustrates the automated CI/CD pipeline process for deploying new code changes to the main branch:

graph LR
    A[New Code Pushed to Main Branch] -->|Triggers| B(Build Pipeline)
    B -->|Builds and Pushes Docker Image| C[Azure Container Registry]
    C -->|Image Pushed| D(Release Pipeline in Azure)
    D -->|Deploys to| E[Azure Kubernetes Service]
```

### Process Description

1. **Code Commit to Main Branch**: Developers push their new code changes to the main branch in the repository. This is the starting point of the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Build Pipeline Activation**: The push to the main branch triggers an automated build pipeline. This pipeline is responsible for compiling the code, running tests, and building the application, thereby creating a new version.

3. **Docker Image Creation and Push**: Upon a successful build, the pipeline creates a Docker image of the application. This Docker image is then pushed to the Azure Container Registry, a private registry for hosting container images.

4. **Release Pipeline Trigger**: The successful push of the Docker image to the Azure Container Registry automatically triggers the release pipeline in Azure DevOps.

5. **Deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: The release pipeline takes the new Docker image and deploys it into the Azure Kubernetes Service. AKS manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of the application within Kubernetes.
